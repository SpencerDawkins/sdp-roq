                SDP Offer/Answer for RTP over QUIC (RoQ)
                  draft-dawkins-avtcore-sdp-roq-latest

Abstract

   This document describes several new SDP "proto" and "attribute-name"
   attribute values in the "Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   Parameters" IANA registry that can be used to describe QUIC transport
   for RTP and RTCP packets, and describes how SDP Offer/Answer can be
   used to set up an RTP connection using QUIC as a transport protocol.
   These new values are necessary to allow the use of QUIC as an
   underlying transport protocol for RTP applications that commonly use
   SDP as a session signaling protocol to set up RTP connections, such
   as SIP and WebRTC.

   This document also contains non-normative guidance for implementers.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes several new SDP "proto" and "attribute-name"
   attribute values in the "Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   Parameters" IANA registry ([SDP-protos] and [SDP-attribute-name])
   that can be used to describe QUIC transport for RTP and RTCP packets
   (hereafter abbreviated as "RoQ"), and describes how SDP Offer/Answer
   ([RFC3264]) can be used to set up an ([RFC3550]) connection using
   QUIC ([RFC9000] and related specifications), as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic].  These new values are necessary to
   allow the use of QUIC as an underlying transport protocol for RTP
   applications that commonly use SDP as a session signaling protocol to
   set up RTP connections, such as SIP ([RFC3261]) and WebRTC
   ([RFC8825]).

   The normative descriptions and requirements for RoQ SDP appear in
   Section 3, Section 4, and Section 5.

   Non-normative guidance for implementers appears in Section 6.

   A sample SDP offer appears in Section 7.

1.1.  Notes for Readers

   (Note to RFC Editor - if this document ever reaches you, please
   remove this section)

   This document has not yet been adopted by any IETF working group, so
   does not carry any special status within the IETF.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Because the use of SDP to describe RTP over QUIC transport relies
   heavily on terminology introduced in
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic], the definitions in that document
   are prerequisite for understanding this document, and those terms are
   included here by reference.

3.  New SDP Protocol identifiers

   This document reuses the following AVP profiles from [SDP-protos], in
   order to allow existing SIP and RTCWEB RTP applications to migrate
   more easily to RTP over QUIC:

   *  RTP/AVP ("RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal
      Control"), as defined in [RFC3551].

   *  RTP/AVPF ("Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control
      Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF)"), as defined in
      [RFC4585].

   *  RTP/SAVP ("The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"), as
      defined in [RFC3711].

   *  RTP/SAVPF ("Extended Secure RTP Profile for Real-time Transport
      Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF)"), as defined
      in [RFC5124].

3.1.  The QUIC proto

   The 'QUIC' protocol identifier is similar to the 'UDP' and 'TCP'
   protocol identifiers in that it only describes the transport
   protocol, and not the upper-layer protocol.

   An 'm' line that specifies 'QUIC' MUST further qualify the
   application-layer protocol using an fmt identifier, such as
   "QUIC/RTP/AVPF".

   Media described using an 'm' line containing the 'QUIC' protocol
   identifier are carried using QUIC streams, as defined in [RFC9000],
   or in QUIC DATAGRAMs, as defined in [RFC9221].

   The following is an update to the ABNF for an 'm' line, as specified
   by [RFC8866], that defines a new value for the QUIC protocol.

      media-field =         %s"m" "=" media SP port \["/" integer\]
                                SP proto 1*(SP fmt) CRLF

      m= line parameter        parameter value(s)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      <media>:                 (unchanged from RFC8866)
      <proto>:                 'QUIC'
      <port>:                  UDP port number
      <fmt>:                   (unchanged from RFC8866)

3.2.  RoQ RTP Protos

   As much as possible, attributes used in this section are reused from
   other specifications, with references to the original definitions.

3.2.1.  The QUIC/RTP/AVP proto

   The following is an update to the ABNF for an 'm' line, as specified
   by [RFC8866], that defines a new value for the QUIC/RTP/AVP protocol.

                                SP proto 1*(SP fmt) CRLF

      <fmt>:                   (unchanged from RFC8866)

3.2.2.  The QUIC/RTP/AVPF proto

   The following is an update to the ABNF for an 'm' line, as specified

                                SP proto 1*(SP fmt) CRLF

      <port>:                  UDP port number
      <fmt>:                   (unchanged from RFC8866)

3.2.3.  The QUIC/RTP/SAVP proto

   The following is an update to the ABNF for an 'm' line, as specified

   protocol.

   by [RFC8866], that defines a new value for the QUIC/RTP/SAVPF
   protocol.

      media-field =         %s"m" "=" media SP port \["/" integer\]
                                SP proto 1*(SP fmt) CRLF

      <fmt>:                   (unchanged from RFC8866)

4.  New SDP Attribute-Names for RoQ

   This section describes new SDP attributes that are created for use
   with RoQ.

4.1.  RoQ QUIC-DATAGRAMs Attribute

   As noted in [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic], the RoQ specification
   only assumes a baseline QUIC implementation as defined in [RFC8999],
   [RFC9000], [RFC9001], and [RFC9002], and this baseline does not
   provide unreliable datagrams, which are defined in [RFC9221].

   It is very likely that RoQ implementers will wish to use QUIC
   DATAGRAMs, for a variety of reasons too large to list in this
   specification.

   In order to support this capability, this section defines a new SDP
   media-level attribute, "quic-datagrams".  The attribute can be
   associated with an SDP media description ("m=" line) with any of the
   QUIC proto values defined in Section 3.1.

   Actual support for QUIC DATAGRAMs is negotiated between two QUIC
   endpoints, as described in Section 3 of [RFC9221], and nothing
   specified in SDP will cause a QUIC endpoint that does not advertise
   support for QUIC DATAGRAMs to suddenly begin to support them.
   However, it may be useful to tell a RoQ receiver that the RoQ sender
   plans to send QUIC DATAGRAMs, and to allow a RoQ receiver to tell the
   SDP sender that the RoQ receiver does not plan to support receiving
   QUIC DATAGRAMs for that media flow.

   If the quic-datagrams attribute is present, the RoQ sender indicates
   its intention to use QUIC DATAGRAMs for the associated media flow,
   and the RoQ receiver indicates its willingness to accept QUIC
   DATAGRAMs for that media flow.

   The quic-datagrams attribute is OPTIONAL for RoQ applications, even
   when the sender intends to use QUIC DATAGRAMs.  Omitting the quic-
   datagrams attribute merely complicates the sender's decision whether
   to send specific media using QUIC DATAGRAMs.

   If the attribute is not present in SDP, the sender sends its QUIC
   Initial packet with a non-zero max_datagram_frame_size QUIC transport
   parameter, and the receiver with a non-zero max_datagram_frame_size
   QUIC transport parameter, all will proceed normally.  If the sender
   attempts to send DATAGRAMs before it receives a non-zero
   name=max_datagram_frame_size QUIC transport parameter in the initial
   handshake, this is a QUIC PROTOCOL_VIOLATION, as described in
   Section 3 of [RFC9221].

   The definition of the SDP "quic-datagrams" attribute is:

   Attribute name: quic-datagrams

   Type of attribute: session or media

   Mux category: IDENTICAL

      *NOTE:* This specification sets the mux category (as discussed in
      Section 4 of [RFC8859]) as IDENTICAL, as an RTP mixer which is
      multiplexing several incoming streams onto one connection needs to
      provide the same quidance to a RoQ receiver for all multiplexed
      media flows.

   Subject to charset: No

   Purpose: This attribute provides a hint as to whether the media
   associated with the SDP media description is likely to arrive via
   QUIC DATAGRAMs.  It is a property attribute, which does not take a
   value.

4.2.  RoQ Flow Identifiers

   Section 5.1 of [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic] introduces a
   multiplexing identifier for RTP flows carried over a QUIC connection
   called "Flow Identifiers".  This section defines a new SDP media-
   level attribute, "roq-flow-id".  The attribute can be associated with
   an SDP media description ("m=" line) with any of the QUIC proto
   values defined in Section 3.1.  In that case, the "m=" line port
   value indicates the port of the underlying QUIC transport UDP port,
   and the "roq-flow-id" value indicates the RoQ Flow Identifier.

   No default value is defined for the SDP "roq-flow-id" attribute.
   Therefore, if the attribute is not present, the associated "m=" line
   MUST be considered invalid.

   The definition of the SDP "roq-flow-id" attribute is:

   Attribute name: roq-flow-id

   Type of attribute: session or media

   Mux category: CAUTION

      *NOTE:* This specification sets the mux category (as discussed in
      Section 4 of [RFC8859]) as CAUTION, as an RTP mixer which is
      multiplexing several incoming streams onto one connection needs to
      ensure that RoQ Flow Identifiers do not overlap, and might need to
      rewrite the Flow Identifiers in received streams when further
      multiplexing them.

   Subject to charset: No

   Purpose: This attribute indicates the RoQ Flow Idenfitier associated
   with the SDP media description.

   Reference: [I-D.dawkins-avtcore-sdp-roq] (This document)

   Syntax:

       roq-flow-id = 1*19(DIGIT) ; DIGIT defined in RFC 4566

   The RoQ flow identifier range is between 0 and 4611686018427387903
   (2^62 - 1) (both included).  Leading zeroes MUST NOT be used.

5.  Special Considerations for Selected SDP Attributes When Using RoQ
    Transport

   This section does not introduce new SDP attribute extensions, but
   describes how some existing SDP attribute extensions are reused to
   describe RoQ media flows.

   We have two goals for this section:

   *  To describe how existing SDP attributes are used differently in
      order to support RoQ, and

   *  To be able to make the statement that other existing SDP attribute
      extensions can be reused with RoQ, with no special considerations.

   *Editors' Note:* What other considerations have we missed, that need
   to be mentioned here?

   This document assumes that an authenticated QUIC connection will be
   opened using a "roq" ALPN or some other ALPN, as described in
   Section 4.1 of [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic].

   *Editor's Note:* Do we need to mention the SDP "tls-id" attribute,
   defined in [RFC8842]?  That spec is DTLS-specific, but whether it
   would also apply to TLS/QUIC connections changing five-tuples isn't
   clear to Spencer.  This may require some conversations about QUIC
   connection migration (and, of course, Multipath QUIC, when
   [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-multipath] leaves the QUIC working group).

5.1.  The SDP "setup" Attribute

   The SDP "setup" attribute, defined for media over TCP in [RFC4145],
   is reused to indicate which endpoint initiates a QUIC connection
   (whether the endpoint actively opens a QUIC connection, or accepts an
   incoming QUIC connection.  This attribute MUST be present in SDP
   offers and answers for RoQ.

5.2.  The SDP "connection" Attribute

   The SDP "connection" attribute, defined for TCP in [RFC4145], is
   reused to indicate whether the endpoint will open a new QUIC
   connection, or reuse an existing QUIC connection.  This attribute
   MUST be present in SDP offers and answers for RoQ.

5.3.  The SDP "fingerprint" Attribute

   Because QUIC itself uses the TLS handshake as described in [RFC9001],
   the parties to a RoQ session MUST also provide authentication
   certificates as part of the TLS handshake procedure, as described in
   Section 5 of [RFC8122].  When self-signed certificates are used,
   certificate fingerprint is represented in SDP using the fingerprint
   SDP attribute, as illustrated in Section 3.4 of [RFC8122], in order
   to provide assurance that two endpoints with no prior relationship
   are not being subjected to a man-in-the-middle attack.

5.4.  The SDP "rtcp-mux" Attribute

   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic] defines how RTP and RTCP can be
   multiplexed onto a single QUIC connection.  An application that will
   perform this multiplexing MUST include the "rtcp-mux" attribute
   defined in [RFC5761] in its SDP signaling.

6.  Implementation Topics

   *Note:* Section 6 contains no normative requirements.

   Section 3 and Section 4 of this document provide normative
   requirements for RoQ endpoints that use SDP for signaling.

   Beyond those normative requirements, there are topics that are worth
   considering as part of implementation work, because we have been
   asked, "but what about the grommet SDP extension?"  These topics are
   not part of the normative "SDP for RoQ" specification, but are
   gathered here for now.  These topics might better appear in an
   appendix, a separate "SDP for RoQ Implementation Guide", or even best
   included in the GitHub repository Wiki for this document, because
   that would allow us to maintain this material on an ongoing basis.

   *Editors' Question:* We've been asked about interaction with UDP-
   Connect to open pinholes in corporate proxies.  What is there to say
   about that, in this specification?

6.1.  Bundling Considerations

   [RFC8843] describes a Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping
   Framework extension called 'BUNDLE'.  The extension can be used with
   the SDP offer/answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a single
   transport (5-tuple) for sending and receiving media described by
   multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" sections).

   The authors believe that no special considerations apply when using
   BUNDLE with a single QUIC connection carrying RoQ.

   If an application uses multiple 5-tuples in order to allow QUIC
   Connection Migration as described in Section 9 of [RFC9000], it is
   assumed that only one QUIC path will be active at any given time.

   If an application uses multiple 5-tuples in order to make use of the
   Multipath Extension for QUIC as described in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-multipath], this would allow multiple QUIC paths
   to be active simultaneously, and this assumption will need revisiting
   when [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-multipath] is approved.

6.2.  Implications of Replacing RTCP Feedback with QUIC Feedback

   Section 10.4 of [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic] describes how some
   RTCP feedback can be replaced by equivalent statistics that are
   already collected by QUIC.  The exact RTCP feedback that can be
   replaced depends on the QUIC statistics exposed by the underlying
   QUIC implementation, and these QUIC statistics might depend in turn
   on QUIC extensions supported in the underlying QUIC implementation.
   The set of possible relevant QUIC extensions is not fixed, but some
   discussion appears in Section 11 of [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic].
   For these reasons, decisions about what RTCP feedback can be replaced
   will always be media-dependent and implementation-dependent.

   It is assumed that an implementer will review the application
   requirements, the RTP proto in use, the available RTCP feedback for
   the media types being transferred, and available QUIC statistics, and
   will do the right thing.

   More information about what RTCP feedback might be replaced by QUIC
   statistics, and what is possible, appears in Appendix B of
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic].

   *Editors' Question:* The API between QUIC and RoQ is, of course, a
   private matter, but in at least some cases, it might be useful to
   specify specific QUIC feedback substitutions so that the other RoQ
   endpoint does not provide RTCP feedback that this RoQ endpoint does
   not need and does not plan to use. *We almost certainly need
   implementation and deployment experience before we can do more than
   offer a strawman proposal.* Spencer suggests that we include any
   IETF-specified QUIC feedback substitutions in separate documents, as
   we do with RTCP extensions today, or even include them in the GitHub
   repository Wiki for this document.

6.3.  Implications of Congestion Control

   A significant distinction between QUIC transport and UDP transport is
   that QUIC transport is always congestion-controlled at the QUIC
   layer.  For RTP media, this ought to be a difference without a
   difference.  Any RTP application ought to perform flow control and
   congestion control using a control mechanism that is appropriate for
   the media being transferred, and this applies to RoQ applications as
   well.

   Having said this, it is worth saying that RoQ applications can use
   any RTCP mechanisms such as Codec Control Messages [RFC5104] that can
   affect variables such as the Maximum Media Stream Bit Rate, as long
   as the RTP application respects the relevant congestion control
   considerations (in the case of Codec Control Messages, these
   considerations appear in Section 5 of [RFC5104]).

   RoQ applications can also use RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Feedback
   for Congestion Control, as described in [RFC8888].

   Because RoQ applications are always congestion controlled at the QUIC
   connection level, QUIC congestion control also acts as an RTP Circuit
   Breaker [RFC8083], with no special considerations for RoQ.

6.4.  Implications of using ICE with RoQ

   Because a peer address is validated during QUIC connection
   establishment as described in Section 8.1 of [RFC9000], when a RoQ
   endpoint uses ICE [RFC8445] to communicate with another RoQ endpoint,
   an ICE agent will have already performed ICE candidate pair
   connectivity checking before a QUIC connection can be opened for use
   with RoQ.

   An implementer should be aware that it is possible for a RoQ
   connection to be subject to "ping"/liveness checks at several
   different levels:

   *  QUIC PING frames, as described in Section 10.1.2 of [RFC9000]

   *  ICE keepalives, as described in Section 10 of [RFC5245] and in
      [RFC6263]

   *  ICE consent freshness, as described in [RFC7675]

   *  RTCP packets, as described in Section 6.2 of [RFC3550]

   The following considerations are worth reviewing for implementers.

   *  QUIC PING frames are entirely under the control of an
      implementation.  If a QUIC connection carries RTP/RTCP traffic,
      the RTCP transmission interval is likely to suffice for RTP
      liveness detection, but a wise implementer will look at this in
      their environment and proceed accordingly.

   *  ICE consent freshness, as described in Section 4 of [RFC7675],
      also serves the ICE keepalive function, so ICE keepalives are no
      longer necessary.

   *  At least some RTCP feedback might be unnecessary, as described in
      Section 6.2, so a wise implementer will look at what RTCP feedback
      can be replaced with QUIC feedback.

7.  A QUIC/RTP/AVPF Offer Example

   *Editor's Note:* Spencer has been updating this example while working
   on the document, but we will need to review it carefully, before
   requesting Working Group Last Call.

   *Note:* Section 7 contains no normative requirements.

   A complete example of an SDP offer using QUIC/RTP/AVPF might look

                                  Table 1

   This example is largely based on an example appearing in [RFC8866],
   Section 5, but includes the necessary protos and attribute-names for
   RoQ SDP.

   This SDP offer might be included in a SIP INVITE, for example.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations sections of the Normative References used
   in this document are incorporated by reference.

8.1.  AV Profile-related Security Considerations

   This document currently defines the QUIC/RTP/SAVP and QUIC/RTP/SAVPF
   secure profiles, although this might seem unnecessary, because RoQ
   already uses QUIC security mechanisms.  That choice is made for two
   reasons:

   *  If an implementer wishes to use an existing RTP application over
      RoQ, continuing to support existing legacy secure profiles
      minimizes the changes required to the implementations at each end.

   *  If a RoQ RTP endpoint is communicating with a non-RoQ RTP endpoint
      using an Top-PtP-Translator RTP middlebox (as described in
      Section 3.2.1 of [RFC7667], the RoQ endpoint might reasonably use
      a secure AVP profile over QUIC when sending to the middlebox,
      because the sending endpoint doesn't have any way to control or
      even discover whether the RTP middlebox used a secure profile when
      forwarding RTP to a non-RoQ endpoint.

   If this is not a good plan, there are two alternatives.

   *  We can REQUIRE conformant RoQ middleboxes to bridge between AVP
      and AVPF profiles carried over RoQ and SAVP and SAVPF profiles
      carried using other transports, so that insecure media flows are
      not relayed over insecure transport protocols.

   *  Alternatively, an implementation can use SFRAME as described in
      [RFC9605] to achieve end-to-end media security, at the price of
      disallowing some types of translating middleboxes (for example,
      Topo-Media-Translator middleboxes, as described in Section 3.2.1.2
      of [RFC7667].

   *Editors' Question:* We will need discussion within the working group
   to determine whether we do need to include QUIC/RTP/SAVP and
   QUIC/RTP/SAVPF in this specification.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines new IANA values in the [SDP-protos] and
   [SDP-attribute-name] registries.

9.1.  quic-datagrams

   This document defines a new SDP media-level attribute, "quic-
   datagrams".  The details of the attribute are defined in Section 4.1.

9.2.  roq-flow-id

   This document defines a new SDP media-level attribute, "roq-flow-id".
   The details of the attribute are defined in Section 4.2.
