                SDP Offer/Answer for RTP over QUIC (RoQ)
                  draft-dawkins-avtcore-sdp-roq-latest

Abstract

   This document describes several new SDP "proto" and "attribute-name"
   attribute values in the "Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   Parameters" IANA registry that can be used to describe QUIC transport
   for RTP and RTCP packets, and describes how SDP Offer/Answer can be
   used to set up an RTP connection using QUIC as a transport protocol.

   These proto values are necessary to allow the use of QUIC as an
   underlying transport protocol for applications such as SIP and WebRTC
   that commonly use SDP as a session signaling protocol to set up RTP
   connections.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes several new SDP "proto" and "attribute-name"
   attribute values in the "Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   Parameters" IANA registry ([SDP-parameters] and [SDP-attribute-name])
   that can be used to describe QUIC transport for RTP and RTCP packets,
   and describes how SDP Offer/Answer ([RFC3264]) can be used to set up
   an RTP ([RFC3550]) connection using QUIC ([RFC9000] and related
   specifications), as defined in [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic].

   These proto values are necessary to allow the use of QUIC as an
   underlying transport protocol for applications such as SIP
   ([RFC3261]) and WebRTC ([RFC8825]) that commonly use SDP as a session
   signaling protocol to set up RTP connections.

1.1.  Scope of this document

   This document focuses on the IANA registration and description of the
   RTP sessions using SDP Offer/Answer, as would be the case for many
   current RTP applications in common use, such as SIP ([RFC3261]) and
   WebRTC ([RFC8825]).

1.2.  Notes for Readers

   (Note to RFC Editor - if this document ever reaches you, please
   remove this section)

   This document is intended for publication as a standards-track RFC in
   the IETF stream, but thus far has not been adopted by any IETF
   working group, so does not carry any special status within the IETF.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Because the use of SDP to describe RTP over QUIC transport relies
   heavily on terminology introduced in
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic], the definitions in that document
   are prerequisite for understanding this document, and those terms are
   included here by reference.

3.  Protocol identifiers

   This document reuses the following AVP profiles, in order to allow
   existing SIP and RTCWEB RTP applications to migrate more easily to
   RTP over QUIC:

   *  RTP/AVP ("RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal
      Control"), as defined in [RFC3551].

   *  RTP/AVPF ("Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control
      Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF)"), as defined in
      [RFC4585].

   *  RTP/SAVP ("The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"), as
      defined in [RFC3711].

   *  RTP/SAVPF ("Extended Secure RTP Profile for Real-time Transport
      Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF)"), as defined
      in [RFC5124].

3.1.  The QUIC proto

   The 'QUIC' protocol identifier is similar to the 'UDP' and 'TCP'
   protocol identifiers in that it only describes the transport
   protocol, and not the upper-layer protocol.

   An 'm' line that specifies 'QUIC' MUST further qualify the
   application-layer protocol using an fmt identifier, such as
   "QUIC/RTP/AVPF".

   Media described using an 'm' line containing the 'QUIC' protocol
   identifier are carried using QUIC streams, as defined in [RFC9000],
   or in QUIC DATAGRAMs, as defined in [RFC9221].

   The following is an update to the ABNF for an 'm' line, as specified
   by [RFC8866], that defines a new value for the QUIC protocol.

      media-field =         %s"m" "=" media SP port \["/" integer\]
                                SP proto 1*(SP fmt) CRLF

      m= line parameter        parameter value(s)

   ## RoQ RTP Protos {#rtp-protos}

   As much as possible, attributes used in this section are reused from
   other specifications, with references to the original definitions.

   protocol.

      media-field =         %s"m" "=" media SP port \["/" integer\]

      <fmt>:                   (unchanged from {{RFC8866}})

3.1.4.  The QUIC/RTP/SAVPF proto

   The following is an update to the ABNF for an 'm' line, as specified
   by [RFC8866], that defines a new value for the QUIC/RTP/SAVPF
   protocol.

      media-field =         %s"m" "=" media SP port \["/" integer\]
                                SP proto 1*(SP fmt) CRLF

      <proto>:                 'QUIC/RTP/SAVPF'
      <port>:                  UDP port number
      <fmt>:                   (unchanged from {{RFC8866}})

3.2.  RoQ QUIC-DATAGRAMs Attribute

   As noted in [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic], the RoQ specification
   only assumes a baseline QUIC implementation as defined in [RFC8999],
   [RFC9000], [RFC9001], and [RFC9002], and this baseline does not
   provide unreliable datagrams, which are defined in [RFC9221].

   It is very likely that RoQ implementers will wish to use QUIC
   DATAGRAMs, for a variety of reasons too large to list in this
   specification.

   Actual support for QUIC DATAGRAMs is negotiated between two QUIC
   endpoints, as described in Section 3 of [RFC9221], and nothing
   specified in SDP will cause a QUIC endpoint that does not advertise
   support for QUIC DATAGRAMs to suddenly begin to support them.
   However, it may be useful to tell a RoQ receiver that the RoQ sender
   plans to send QUIC DATAGRAMs, and to allow a RoQ receiver to tell the
   SDP sender that the RoQ receiver does not plan to support QUIC
   DATAGRAMs for that media flow.

   In order to provide this capability, this section defines a new SDP
   media-level attribute, "quic-datagrams".  The attribute can be
   associated with an SDP media description ("m=" line) with any of the
   QUIC proto values defined in Section 3.1.

   If the quic-datagrams attribute is present, the RoQ sender indicates
   its intention to use QUIC DATAGRAMs for the associated media flow,
   and the RoQ receiver indicates its willingness to accept QUIC
   DATAGRAMs for that media flow.

   The definition of the SDP "quic-datagrams" attribute is:

   Attribute name: quic-datagrams

   Type of attribute: media

   Mux category: IDENTICAL

      *Author's Note:* This specification sets the mux category (as
      discussed in Section 4 of [RFC8859]) as IDENTICAL, as an RTP mixer
      which is multiplexing several incoming streams onto one connection
      needs to provide the same quidance to a RoQ receiver for all
      multiplexed media flows.

   Subject to charset: No

   Purpose: This attribute provides a hint as to whether the media
   associated with the SDP media description is likely to arrive via
   QUIC DATAGRAMs.  It is a property attribute, which does not take a
   value.

3.3.  RoQ Flow Identifiers

   Section 5.1 of [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic] introduces a
   multiplexing identifier for RTP flows carried over a QUIC connection
   called "Flow Identifiers".  This section defines a new SDP media-
   level attribute, "roq-flow-id".  The attribute can be associated with
   an SDP media description ("m=" line) with any of the QUIC proto
   values defined in Section 3.1.  In that case, the "m=" line port
   value indicates the port of the underlying QUIC transport UDP port,
   and the "roq-flow-id" value indicates the RoQ Flow Identifier.

   No default value is defined for the SDP "roq-flow-id" attribute.
   Therefore, if the attribute is not present, the associated "m=" line
   MUST be considered invalid.

   The definition of the SDP "roq-flow-id" attribute is:

   Attribute name: roq-flow-id

   Type of attribute: media

   Mux category: CAUTION

      *Author's Note:* This specification sets the mux category (as
      discussed in Section 4 of [RFC8859]) as CAUTION, as an RTP mixer
      which is multiplexing several incoming streams onto one connection
      needs to ensure that RoQ Flow Identifiers do not overlap, and
      might need to rewrite the Flow Identifiers in received streams
      when further multiplexing them.

   Subject to charset: No

   Purpose: This attribute indicates the RoQ Flow Idenfitier associated
   with the SDP media description.

   Syntax:

       roq-flow-id = 1*19(DIGIT) ; DIGIT defined in RFC 4566

   (2^62 - 1) (both included).  Leading zeroes MUST NOT be used.

3.4.  Discussion

   *NOTE:* This section is still under construction.  The contents are
   likely to change significantly before settling down!

   "QUIC", "QUIC/RTP/AVP", "QUIC/RTP/AVPF", "QUIC/RTP/SAVP", and
   "QUIC/RTP/SAVPF" are defined in the document now.

   This document currently includes secure profiles for middlebox
   support of legacy RTP endpoints.  The thinking is that if a RoQ
   endpoint is communicating with a non-RoQ RTP endpoint using an RTP
   middlebox, the RoQ endpoint might reasonably use an insecure AVP
   profile when sending to the middlebox, but that endpoint doesn't have
   any way to control whether the RTP middlebox uses a secure profile
   when exchanging RTP with a non-RoQ endpoint.

   RoQ allows the encapsulation of RTP in both QUIC streams and in QUIC
   DATAGRAMs.  We will include "stream" and "dgram" variants of any
   profiles we define.

   We've talked (a LOT) about including variants that failover to
   TCP/UDP/QUIC transport if UDP is blocked, so that an endpoint can
   proceed after ICE candidate probing, but can we assume that
   applications that can do other encapsulations will offer protocol
   identifiers for those encapsulations, in addition to "QUIC/RTP/AVPF"
   and related protocol identifiers?

3.5.  Opening a QUIC connection for use with RoQ

   This document assumes that an authenticated QUIC connection will be
   opened using a "roq" ALPN or some other ALPN, as described in
   Section 4.1 of [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic].

   The SDP "setup" attribute, defined for media over TCP in [RFC4145],
   will be reused to indicate which endpoint initiates a QUIC connection
   (whether the endpoint actively opens a QUIC connection, or accepts an
   incoming QUIC connection.

   *Editor's Note:* do the actpass and holdconn setup roles have meaning
   for RTP over QUIC?

   The SDP "connection" attribute, defined for TCP in [RFC4145], will be
   reused to indicate whether the endpoint will open a new QUIC
   connection, or reuse an existing QUIC connection.

   *  [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic] defines how RTP and RTCP can be
      multiplexed onto a single QUIC connection.  An application that
      will perform this multiplexing uses the "rtcp-mux" attribute
      defined in [RFC5761] in its SDP signaling.

   *  Check QUIC impacts on BUNDLE

   *  Interaction with UDP-Connect to open pinholes in corporate
      proxies?

3.6.  Implications of using ICE with SDP from RFC 8842

   Things to remember in this section

   *  SDP "fingerprint" attribute, defined in [RFC8122]

   *  SDP "tls-id" attribute, defined in [RFC8842]

   *  QUIC address validation and ICE candidate pairs

   *  QUIC Ping frames and ICE consent freshness (RFC 7675)

3.7.  Interaction with Other RTP extensions

   *Editor's Note:* this section is present as a reminder that we need
   to think about this topic as we develop the specification.

3.8.  Negotiating for specific QUIC feedback replacing AVP/AVPF feedback

   Things to remember in this section

   *  What we might say about RFC 4585 AVPF

   *  What we might say about RFC 5104 Codec Control Messages

   *  What we might say about RFC 8888 congestion control

3.9.  Considerations for end-to-end payload protection

   Things to remember in this section

   *  Technical solution - support SFRAME

   *  Human solution - require conformant RoQ middleboxes to bridge
      between RoQ and secure profiles (no RoQ=>AVP, no RoQ=>AVPF)

3.10.  A QUIC/RTP/AVPF Offer Example

   *Editor's Note:* I still need to clean this example up, after
   discussion on the rest of the document.

   A complete example of an SDP offer using QUIC/RTP/AVPF might look

                                 Table 1

   This example is largely based on an example appearing in [RFC8866],
   Section 5, but is using QUIC/RTP/AVPF to support a newer codec.

   Because QUIC uses connections for both streams and datagrams, we are
   reusing two session- and media-level SDP attributes from
   [SDP-attribute-name] that were defined in [RFC4145] for use with TCP:
   setup and connection.

   This example SDP offer might be included in a SIP Invite.

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  New SDP Attributes

5.1.1.  quic-datagrams

   This document defines a new SDP media-level attribute, "quic-
   datagrams".  The details of the attribute are defined in Section 3.2.

5.1.2.  roq-flow-id

   This document defines a new SDP media-level attribute, "roq-flow-id".
   The details of the attribute are defined in Section 3.3.
